# Deep Image Reconstruction from Human Brain Activity: Data

The data required to run the program will be available soon. The files should be saved in the respective directories as follows.

* *eeg* - processed EEG data of 5 subjects
* *eeg_decoded* - decoded hidden representation of image features from EEG data
* *encoded_features* - hidden representation of image features
* *fmri* - processed fMRI data of 5 subjects
* *fmri_decoded* - decoded hidden representation of image features from fMRI data
* *images* - images used in the thesis (18 categories)
* *img_features* - image features extracted from pre-trained VGG19 (all 19 layers)
* *trained_models* - trained autoencoder for encoding and decoding of image features
* *TRAINED_TEST.p* - dictionary containg the IDs of training and testing images
